Testing, testing. Is this thing on?
I have worked in tech for over 20 years.  My first job was posting ads for MSN International websites. I had never coded, didn't really know computers except for basic Word, Excel and Outlook skills.  I learned to read enough html so I could fix a url or make other such small adjustments.
So today I made the attempt to update the theme for this site.  After mutliple attempts trying to update to Midnight or Caymen, I accidently overwrote the main branch, learned how to see what change I made and undo it.  While I still couldn't get the theme changed, I did manage to type my first lines of code.
While I don't feel a great sense of accomplishment, I realize this is not something I've done before. I was nervous to try. I wasn't able to make a change on how this site looks, but I was able to "break it" then fix it again.
And now I have my first official post.
